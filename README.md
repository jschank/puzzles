Programming Puzzles, hosted on github so they are easy to share and discuss

I am using this repository to host all the progamming puzzles I work on. Most are in Ruby.
I'll describe each on below

triangle
--------
Got this puzzle from Workbridge Associates, as being a puzzle standard for Gannett.

Create an application that will take a number in Terminal and output the same number of lines with the same number of digits in each line. Note: elements continue to grow in order.

Enter in terminal:

    $ ruby triangle.rb 4
    Expected result:
    
    1
    2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9 10

I also created a centered version, which required a bit a refactoring. Initially I tried a separate class but that led to a lot of repeated code. The history would show this, but it was easier to just create a fresh repo

fizzbuzz
--------
Clasisc fizz buzz puzzle.  
includes a variety of versions. For example, the classic version with if/elsif/else and modulo arithmetic, a version using Array#map, and a version with no conditional logic - or modulo arithmetic.

International Trade
-------------------
Puzzle from the puzzle node - does currency conversions
I was too late to do it for the meet up, but I think I want to try it anyway

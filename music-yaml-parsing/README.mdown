# Yaml Parsing

Given the a Yaml file of the format found in music.yaml parse the file so that we can access it in Ruby.

Your parsing code should return an object that allows you to access attributes using the [] operator:

    data["genres"].last["artists"].first["albums"].first["tracks"].last["name"] => "But Not For Me"

The returned object should also allow you to access attributes using method calls:

    data.genres.last.artists.first.albums.first.tracks.last.name => "But Not For Me"
